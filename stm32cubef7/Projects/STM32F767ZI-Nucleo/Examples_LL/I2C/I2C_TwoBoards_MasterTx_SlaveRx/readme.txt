@par Example Description

How to transmit data bytes from an I2C master device using polling mode 
to an I2C slave device using interrupt mode. The peripheral is initialized 
with LL unitary service functions to optimize for performance and size.

This example guides you through the different configuration steps by mean of LL API
to configure GPIO and I2C peripherals using two NUCLEO-F767ZI.

Boards: NUCLEO-F767ZI (embeds a STM32F767ZI device)
SCL Pin: PB.10 (CN10, pin 32)
SDA Pin: PB.11 (CN10, pin 34)

The project is splitted in two parts the Master Board and the Slave Board
- Master Board
  I2C1 Peripheral is configured in Master mode (Clock 400Khz).
  And GPIO associated to User push-button is linked with EXTI. 
- Slave Board
  I2C2 Peripheral is configured in Slave mode (Clock 400Khz, Own address 7-bit enabled).

The user can choose between Master and Slave through "#define SLAVE_BOARD"
in the "main.h" file:
- Comment "#define SLAVE_BOARD" to select Master board.
- Uncomment "#define SLAVE_BOARD" to select Slave board.

A first program launch, BOARD SLAVE waiting Address Match code through Handle_I2C_Slave() routine.
LED1 blinks quickly on BOARD MASTER to wait for user-button press.

Example execution:
Press the User push-button on BOARD MASTER to initiate a write request by Master through Handle_I2C_Master() routine.
This action will generate an I2C start condition with the Slave address and a write bit condition.
When address Slave match code is received on I2C2 of BOARD SLAVE, an ADDR event occurs.
Handle_I2C_Slave() routine is then checking Address Match Code and direction Write.
This will allow Slave to enter in receiver mode and then acknowledge Master to send the bytes.
When acknowledge is received on I2C1 (Master), a TXIS event occurs.
This will allow Master to transmit a byte to the Slave.
Each time a byte is received on I2C2 (Slave), an RXNE event occurs until a STOP condition.
And so each time the Slave acknowledge the byte received a TXIS event occurs on Master side.
Master auto-generate a Stop condition when size of data to transmit is achieved.

The STOP condition generate a STOP event and initiate the end of reception on Slave side.
Handle_I2C_Slave() and Handle_I2C_Master() routine are then clearing the STOP flag in both side.

LED1 is On :
- Slave side if data are well received.
- Master side if transfer sequence is completed.

In case of errors, LED1 is blinking.

@Note�If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
 �����then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      In case of constraints it is possible to configure the MPU as "Write through/not shareable" to guarantee the cache coherence at write access but the user
	  has to ensure the cache maintenance at read access though.
������The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
����� It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
������In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
������Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
������Please refer to the AN4838 �Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs�
������Please refer to the AN4839 �Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series�

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F767xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-F767ZI board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - NUCLEO-F767ZI Set-up
    - Connect GPIOs connected to Board Slave I2C2 SCL/SDA (PB.10 and PB.11)
    to respectively Board Master SCL and SDA pins of I2C1 (PB.6 and PB.9).
      - I2C2_SCL  PB.10 (CN10, pin 32) : connected to I2C1_SCL PB.6 (CN10, pin 13) 
      - I2C2_SDA  PB.11 (CN10, pin 34) : connected to I2C1_SDA PB.9 (CN7, pin 4)
    - Connect Master board GND to Slave Board GND

  - Launch the program. Press User push-button to initiate a write request by Master 
      then Slave receive bytes.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory (The user can choose between Master 
   and Slave target through "#define SLAVE_BOARD" in the "main.h" file)
    o Comment "#define SLAVE_BOARD" and load the project in Master Board
    o Uncomment "#define SLAVE_BOARD" and load the project in Slave Board
 - Run the example
