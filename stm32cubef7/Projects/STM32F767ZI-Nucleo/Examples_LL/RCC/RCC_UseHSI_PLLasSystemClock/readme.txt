@par Example Description

Modification of the PLL parameters in run time.

In this example, the toggling frequency of the green LED1 depends on the system clock 
frequency and, each time the user-button is pressed, the PLL switches between two configurations.
This make the LED1 blinking speed to highlight the system clock frequency changes.

In this example, after start-up, SYSCLK is configured to the max frequency using the PLL with
HSE as clock source.
Then, at user-button press, an automatic switch is done between PLL with HSI as clock source (SYSCLK
set to 40MHz) and PLL with HSI as clock source (SYSCLK set to 216MHz). 
LED1 will toggle differently between the 2 configurations (quick toggle with HSI configuration at 216MHz).

To detect a problem with PLL configuration, switch USE_TIMEOUT can be enabled. Then in case of issues, 
LED1 will toggle every 1 second.
Note: "uwFrequency" variable can be added in LiveWatch to monitor the system clock frequency.

@par Keywords

System, RCC, PLL, PLLCLK, SYSCLK, HSE, Clock, Oscillator, HSI

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      In case of constraints it is possible to configure the MPU as "Write through/not shareable" to guarantee the cache coherence at write access but the user
	  has to ensure the cache maintenance at read access though.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”
